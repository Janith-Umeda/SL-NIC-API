# Description
This api was made using php language. You can Use this API in your Projects Using AJAX Calls.
Note But You may can't use GET or REQUEST Methods for that api link (https://slnic.iceiy.com/api/?nic=) as an ajax call because of i was hosted this API on a free hosting server. however You can download that API php source code on my github profile and you can upload it to your web server. then you can use GET/REQUEST Methods. SORRY ABOUT THAT :)
